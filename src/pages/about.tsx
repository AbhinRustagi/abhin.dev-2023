        As an end-to-end product designer, I love solving problems through
        simplifying the complexity and translating data-driven strategy to
        intuitive design. I contribute to designing new features and optimising
        existing products from start to finish. This includes interviewing users
        for research and testing, creating workshops, user flows, wireframes,
        prototypes and dev-ready final designs.

        Currently, Iâ€™m a Product Engineer at Openhouse, where we develop
        powerful technology to help Australian Super Funds deliver outstanding
        outcomes to customers. After hours, I make some exciting things for the
        internet.

        I live in New Delhi, India, where I spend my free time exploring its
        beautiful nature and searching good coffee and good vibes. One of my
        favourite things to do is watching sun rise at Coogee beach.
