**Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹**

I am Abhin Rustagi, a software engineer based out of India.
I have been building websites, web apps, servers, and much more experimental stuff for the last 2 years.

I work the following technologies to name a few: Python, Django, React, Javascript, PostgreSQL, Node.js, GoLang etc.

A curious learner at heart, I have been hacking my way around the vast world of programming & development since the early lockdown days.

I have worked as a freelancer with multiple [SMBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises), in varying neeches. I currently work as a Product Engineer at [Openhouse](https://openhouse.study/). Some of my day to day responsibilities include contributing to the backend infrastructure, conducting technical interviews, helping with DevEx, etc.

Outside of work, I am huge trekking enthusiast, love brewing my own coffee, and the occasional cooking, and a lot more!

Feel free to get in touch with me â€“ [hi@abhin.dev](mailto:hi@abhin.dev)
